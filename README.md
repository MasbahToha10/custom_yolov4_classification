# custom_yolov4_classification
Custom Yolov4 classification model trained on darknet framework. In this project it is implemented in OpenCV DNN using python.
450 high resolution image of bottle and can was used in custom dataset. I've used labelImg to label the images in dataset. 80% data was used for train and rest was used for validation. It took almost 15 hours of traing time with 4800 iteration. The model have shown 92.3% of AP score.
